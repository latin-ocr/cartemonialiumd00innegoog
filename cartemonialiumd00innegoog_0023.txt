of the Bishops of Dunblaue, with their Culdees for witnesees)
and that of Edward de Lnstalric, with his unmountnble seul?
nte scurz-‘ely less interesting.

The Menantery of ciacon-ciat· Num os Saiut Μαι-γ os North
Berwick, is said by Sibbald, (whom Spoteiswood follows) ιο have
been founded by ΜιΙοοΙω, Eflrl of Fife, in the γεω 1216.³ These
Camers show, that it was in existence, nnd pretty richly en-
dowed. at least two generations earlier! The father and grand-
father οἰ Eur! Maleoltm are among its benefactum and the family
of Carrio. with their maala de Scalabroc had bestowed upon the
Nnns a revenne out of Bmebeth, and the Chnmh of West Kil-
bride, before the end of the thh century.

Whecher the original founders or not, the Eat-ln of Fifo were
the Patrone of the Prinry‚⁶ md apparently its chief benefactum.
The Nuus owed υο their munificence the Pan-ish Chul-ch of Snint
Δῃὼ-επ of North Berwiek, the, Churehes of Kilconquhn, Largo,
and Logy, two Hospituls endowed for the reception of the poor

nnd of pilgrims, nt the two ports of the wide ferry-Easlsferry und
North Berwiek; and several estates of land, including the bean-

tiful bank uf Airthry. and “ the land called Gilleealmestun. on
which the Nunnery was built.”

The Church uf Maybule was the gift of the Ean-le of (Σηπία,
who, apparently. took a peculim· interest in the affairs of the
Convent. These benefactione, and that connexion, may perhaps
wan-ant a conjecture that the first Prioress of the Nnnnery whose
name we lenm, was demanded of the ancient Earls of Carrio.
